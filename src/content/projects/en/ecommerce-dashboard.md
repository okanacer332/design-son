## About the Project

We designed a comprehensive dashboard kit that provides the speed, flexibility, and ease of management required for modern e-commerce sites. This kit aims to create a common language for both designers and developers.

### 🛠 Technologies Used

* **React 19 & Next.js 15:** Latest framework infrastructure.
* **Tailwind CSS v4:** Fast and performant style management.
* **Recharts:** Data visualization and analytics charts.
* **Framer Motion:** Fluid interface animations.

### 🌟 Key Features

1.  **Atomic Design:** Consistent structure from the smallest building block to complex pages.
2.  **Dark/Light Mode:** Theme support responsive to system preferences.
3.  **Accessibility (a11y):** Full compliance with WCAG 2.1 standards.

> "A good dashboard is one where the user doesn't have to be told what to do."

### Results
We observed **40% faster development process** and **25% less technical debt** in clients using this kit.
