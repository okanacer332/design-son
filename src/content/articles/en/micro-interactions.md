## Small Details, Big Differences

Micro-interactions are the triggers, rules, feedback, and loops that make a product feel "alive."

### 4 Basic Building Blocks
1.  **Trigger:** The event initiated by the user (click) or the system (notification).
2.  **Rules:** The logic determining how the interaction behaves.
3.  **Feedback:** Visual, auditory, or haptic output showing the user what happened.
4.  **Loops & Modes:** The duration and repetition of the interaction.

A well-designed "Like" button animation can cause dopamine release in the user.
